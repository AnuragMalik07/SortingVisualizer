# SortingVisualizer

Here are three key points that summarize this sorting visualization project:

> Sorting Algorithm Visualization:
The project offers an interactive platform to visualize the working of various sorting algorithms.
Users can observe step-by-step animations of sorting algorithms like Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
Each sorting step is graphically represented, providing a clear understanding of how elements are compared, swapped, and organized within the array.


> Real-time User Interaction:
The program allows users to generate a randomized list of elements and apply different sorting algorithms to it.
Users can control the flow of visualization, pause/resume the animation, and proceed through the sorting process at their own pace.
Interactive controls provide a hands-on learning experience, making it a valuable tool for educational purposes and algorithm understanding.


> SDL Graphics and User-Friendly Interface:
The project leverages the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to create a graphical user interface for the sorting visualization.
Rectangles representing array elements change colors to indicate their current state (being compared, swapped, or sorted).
The user-friendly interface includes keyboard shortcuts to select algorithms, generate new random lists, and exit the visualization, enhancing the overall user experience.
